1. Evaluate below expression without running the code
   int x = 9, y = 12;
   int a = 2, b = 4, c = 6;
   int exp = 4/3 * (x + 34) + 9 * (a + b * c) + (3 + y * (2 + a)) / (a + b*y);
   Note: No program is required. Just give value of exp by calculating manually.

  greater than 10 if its lesser than check further if its lesser or greater than
